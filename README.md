# hello-world
My first repository on github!

I am studying a Higher Diploma in Computer Science at University College Dublin.  It is a one year conversion course, and I am required to do an internship at the end of the second semester.  I have taken modules on Python programming, BASH shell scripting, and Web App Development.  I am currently doing Java programming, data analytics, and software engineering.

I also have a degree in Prosthetics & Orthotics from University of Salford, Manchester.
